# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Project Architecture Additions

To prepare for Firebase integration and an admin dashboard, the following folders have been added:

- `src/services/` – network or backend services (Firebase wrappers will live here)
- `src/hooks/` – reusable custom React hooks (e.g. `useAuth`, `useLoading`)
- `src/context/` – global state providers (an `AppContext` handles loading and user state)
- `src/utils/` – generic helper functions and utilities
- `src/constants/` – shared constants such as route names and configuration keys
- `src/admin/` – placeholder for future protected dashboard components

A basic Firebase service skeleton (`firebaseConfig.js`, `authService.js`, `databaseService.js`) has been created with environment-variable placeholders. `AppContext` is wired up around the router in `App.jsx`, and a `ProtectedRoute` component skeleton exists to guard admin pages.

No existing UI components were modified; these changes are architectural and backward-compatible with your current routes and layout.

The `AppContext` now provides a `globalLoading` flag and a `GlobalLoader` component which is rendered in `Layout.jsx`. When any page sets `globalLoading` to `true` (e.g. during data fetching in `Home.jsx`), a full-screen semi-transparent overlay with a spinner appears above the normal UI.

### UI / UX Upgrades

The front end has been enhanced with a professional NGO-style design system:

- **Typography**: improved hierarchy and custom fonts (`Poppins` for headings, `Inter` for body). Headings and paragraphs use `text-dark` or appropriate off-white hues to ensure readable contrast on themed backgrounds.
- **Color palette**: refined palette built around the logo’s warm brown/gold; includes deep trust blue, warm cream, soft gold, neutral light, and muted brown accents. Multiple background utilities support immersive page tones.
- **Immersive backgrounds**: each page now applies a full-viewport background via `Layout` (never leaving blank white space). Gradients and subtle radial glows are used sparingly for emotional warmth and focus.
- **Spacing**: consistent `py-24`, `px-6` rhythm and extended Tailwind scale.
- **Buttons**: primary buttons use trust blue, secondary use warm gold; hover states darken slightly and scale up. Central `Button` component includes ripple effect.
- **Navbar**: glass blur background, animated underline for active links, smooth mobile menu. Logo integrates the brown/gold tones.
- **Page transitions**: upgraded Framer Motion enter/exit animations.
- **Scroll interactions**: progress indicator at top, staggered section reveals, image zoom on hover.
- **Team section**: interactive member grid with modal details using shared layout animations.
- **Impact map**: map embed with animated markers and regional counters.
- **Donation CTA**: animated gradient background, trust badges, strong call to action.
- **Global loader & scroll restoration**: across all pages.

- **Donation page overhaul**: new payment options (UPI QR, card form, net banking), animated impact transparency cards, navy/sky-blue gradient with gold CTA accents.
- **Events cards**: now show images, elevate on hover, and reveal extra details via a smooth slide-up animation when clicked.
- **Trust member cards**: replaced modal interaction with 3D flip cards featuring tagline overlays and back-side bio/socials.
- **Contact page**: added Instagram/LinkedIn/email/phone icons with hover/tap animations for stronger user engagement.
- **Footer**: quick links are real `NavLink` elements with underline animation and opacity transitions.

Color psychology guide followed:
- Trust & Stability → muted navy/deep blue (`trustBlue`)
- Warmth & Humanity → soft cream (`warmCream`)
- Encouragement & Action → warm gold (`softGold`)
- Credibility → clean white for cards/content
- Emotional comfort → subtle radial gradients
- Logo brown used as small accents (borders, underlines)

These stylistic changes are applied without altering routing or component
structure, keeping the site architecture intact while delivering a cohesive,
trustworthy, emotionally warm visual experience.
